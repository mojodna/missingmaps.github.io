&lt;p&gt;As part of the response to the disaster caused by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), the strongest typhoon ever to make landfall in the Philippines, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redcross.org.ph/&quot;&gt;Philippine Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redcross.org/about-us/our-work/international-services&quot;&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; implemented Tindog Tabang Leyteño, a 3-year recovery project. The project covers 4 municipalities and 23 barangays. The main goal of the project is to contribute to building safe and resilient communities by identifying and addressing various factors that will help people sustainably rebuild their lives, livelihoods, and assets while ensuring that future climate, environmental, and disaster risks are addressed or minimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aerial-imagery-collection&quot;&gt;Aerial imagery collection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) or drones, are increasingly used for &lt;a href=&quot;http://drones.fsd.ch/en/drones-in-humanitarian-action/&quot;&gt;humanitarian purposes&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, we leveraged drones for comprehensive aerial imagery collection to support the recovery program. High-resolution aerial imagery is a valuable resource when creating value-add information products for response, planning, monitoring, and resilience building activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20170727_compare.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;satellite vs drone imagery&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Resolution comparison between satellite imagery available on Google Maps (left) compared to drone imagery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordination and legal aspects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When flying drones, it is important to comply with regulations, conduct activities professionally, and operate safely. Failing to do so could result in backlash against the future utilization of the technology. An FAA certified remote pilot from the American Red Cross GIS team as well as a volunteer that is certified were present for the project activities. During planning stages, we talked through the activities with the Philippine Red Cross. Then we communicated with all the local authorities to obtain their approvals. We then obtained all necessary authorizations from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP). Preparation for the trip was a several month process!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took two fixed-wing drones, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Event38&quot;&gt;Event 38&lt;/a&gt; E384 and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TuffWing&quot;&gt;Tuffwing&lt;/a&gt; UAV Mapper, as well as a small quadcopter, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/djiglobal&quot;&gt;DJI&lt;/a&gt; Mavic Pro. Due to some technical challenges, and difficulties finding suitably large and clear areas for landing the fixed-wing drones, almost all our mapping ended up being with the Mavic. Because we had two pilots we ended up procuring a second Mavic after the first week to double our coverage speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground control points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested using ground controls points (GCPs) in Barangay Marasbaras. We had 12 large fabric markers with distinct patterns that we placed around the area before collecting imagery. By using handheld Garmin GPS units’ waypoint averaging functionality, we could determine more accurate latitude and longitude coordinates for the markers which were then used after image processing to adjust and improve the accuracy of the final map products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mapillary&quot;&gt;Mapillary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we travelled between barangays and walked around the areas, we used a variety of cameras to collect street-level imagery. The geotagged images collected with Sony action cameras, 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; cameras, and smart-phones were then uploaded to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapillary.com/&quot;&gt;Mapillary&lt;/a&gt; where they became part of an ever-growing, community built collection of openly licensed street-level images for the world. The images can provide valuable insights; it is possible to observe signage, the condition of buildings, and other aspects of the environment not visible in vertical aerial/satellite imagery. They allow anyone to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mapillary/status/874978591678791681&quot;&gt;#MapillaryExplore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;processing&quot;&gt;Processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To process aerial drone imagery, we use an open-source toolkit called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/OpenDroneMap#opendronemap&quot;&gt;OpenDroneMap (ODM)&lt;/a&gt;. ODM can combine the series of images captured during flight(s) over an area of interest into a single georeferenced image file that can be used for GIS purposes. We can perform this process in offline environments, having incorporated ODM into the set of software tools that we can run on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/posm/posm#posm&quot;&gt;POSM&lt;/a&gt; portable server. POSM runs on a small piece of hardware that is plugged into a power source and broadcasts a local wifi signal in order to connect devices. When connected to POSM, users can access several pieces of software, such as ODM and other mapping tools, that are normally cloud-based and require an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oam&quot;&gt;OAM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openaerialmap.org/&quot;&gt;OpenAerialMap (OAM)&lt;/a&gt; is a repository of openly licensed imagery and map layer services. We uploaded all the processed imagery to OAM so that it would be easily available for us, and others, to access and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20170727_oam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;OpenAerialMap&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;openstreetmap&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSM in the Philippines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong OSM-PH community and OSM is increasingly considered a useful source of geographic data in the Philippines. The Philippines government has recognized the strengths of OSM and its importance in creating “more accurate street-level risk analysis maps for the Philippines. This in turn will be used in improving disaster management before, during, and after emergencies” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.noah.dost.gov.ph/2016/04/08/map-your-community-in-osm-with-project-noah/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Tasking Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To coordinate the digital volunteers helping to trace the project areas we used the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Tasking Manager to divide each barangay up into a grid of tasks to be systematically traced and then validated by a skilled mapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drone imagery, and the Mapillary images as well, proved useful for detailed, up-to-date tracing of map features into OSM. The improvements over what was possible using only satellite imagery are striking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made all the imagery outputs available through &lt;a href=&quot;https://map.openaerialmap.org/#/125.32379150390624,10.875116370134366,9?_k=xfrwrc&quot;&gt;OAM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=11.061160979894737&amp;amp;lng=125.00135879610951&amp;amp;z=10&quot;&gt;Mapillary&lt;/a&gt;.
We’ve also made the raw datasets of aerial imagery &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX1C0k1TM0op9qQ0m8cXMUsMcUnzw3o7SE5dasOXbf8/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; with the intent that they can be used for purposes such as test datasets for the development of tools like ODM. You can check out the imagery in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanredcross.github.io/ttl-imagery/&quot;&gt;web viewer&lt;/a&gt;. The outputs will be shared with the communities and local government. The American Red Cross will continue to work with the Philippines Red Cross to utilize the data and think about future use of drones. We will continue to share and progress with our learning, and hopefully fly again soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce a new and improved version of POSM – now faster and slicker than ever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our experiences in the field, we made a number of improvements and fixes to help it meet our mapping needs more effectively. We’ve just released the updated system as POSM ~0.7.1 (codename: natural blowfish)~ 0.7.2 (codename: clear hen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additions and improvements include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updates to the admin interface to make the user experience simpler and more straightforward, even as we add functionality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built-in instruction manual. We wrote user-friendly documentation for the set-up and use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://posm.io/&quot;&gt;POSM&lt;/a&gt; and included it in the installer so that it’s available offline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added support for OpenDataKit’s data encryption features. Users can add a private key to their ODK form, upload the form to OpenMapKitServer on POSM, then download and decrypt the data using &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendatakit.org/use/briefcase/&quot;&gt;ODK Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;. This is part of our commitment to protecting sensitive information in the field. Getting started with ODK Briefcase can be a little confusing so we’ve added instructions &lt;a href=&quot;http://posm.io/in-the-field/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public file share now easier to find and use – no configuration changes necessary. Users can connect to POSM’s public file share to add files, apps, and other packages that they may need to share with volunteers or staff in the field&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Selected software components updated (OSM’s iD editor, for example)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;POSM is now faster to install from a USB stick&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Various small bugs found and fixes applied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20170726_pic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New POSM Admin interface&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20170726_pic2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Online and offline instruction guide&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;We wrote a step-by-step instruction guide where project managers can find everything they need to know about getting, setting up, and using a POSM. Troubleshooting tips are included and the full guide can be accessed [online](www.posm.io) or through the POSM itself. CC-BY American Red Cross&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POSM is ready for your offline enumeration, mapping, and imagery needs with its integration of OpenDataKit, OpenMapKit, Field Papers, OpenStreetMap, OpenDroneMap, and the POSM Imagery API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/posm/posm-build/releases&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and we encourage everyone using POSM to update their device(s) with this version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited about these improvements and hope you are, too!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Emily Eros, Seth Fitzsimmons</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="POSM" /><summary type="html">We are pleased to announce a new and improved version of POSM – now faster and slicker than ever!</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Volunteers in Uganda and Turkey Rally to Support Refugees on World Refugee Day</title><link href="/blog/2017/07/10/world-refugee-day-2017/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Volunteers in Uganda and Turkey Rally to Support Refugees on World Refugee Day" /><published>2017-07-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/blog/2017/07/10/world-refugee-day-2017</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2017/07/10/world-refugee-day-2017/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-connects-kampala-and-istanbul&quot;&gt;What connects Kampala and Istanbul?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(originally posted to the Humanitarian OpenSteetMap Team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotosm.org/updates/2017-07-03_volunteers_in_uganda_and_turkey_rally_to_support_refugees_on_world_refugee_day&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on July 3, 2017)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What connects Kampala and Istanbul? You might be thinking that Kampala and Istanbul are worlds apart, but volunteers in both cities rallied around a common cause for World Refugee Day - working together to map priority areas in Uganda that require urgent humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the protracted conflicts in Syria and South Sudan, displaced civilians continue to seek safety in neighboring countries and beyond. Turkey and Uganda have gained prominence on the world stage for opening their borders to receive refugees, particularly those fleeing from respective conflicts in Syria and South Sudan. More broadly, Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees in the world, with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) citing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unhcr.org/statistics/unhcrstats/5943e8a34/global-trends-forced-displacement-2016.html&quot;&gt;estimated 2.9 million people in country in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Uganda hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa, with over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57050#.WVEh0ROGOgQ&quot;&gt;1.2 million&lt;/a&gt; refugees and asylum seekers in country today. And these numbers continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2,000 people a day are crossing the border into Northern Uganda, with little more than they can carry. This has sparked a humanitarian emergency that the United Nations Secretary-General described as the “biggest refugee exodus since the genocide in Rwanda.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background-on-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team-and-the-refugee-crisis-in-uganda&quot;&gt;Background on Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and the Refugee Crisis in Uganda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empowering refugees and host communities are key elements of the Ugandan national strategy to ensure self-reliance, resilience and accountability to displaced populations, in a context where refugees are unlikely to return to their countries of origin any time soon. National and district level authorities’ capacity should also be enhanced to provide assistance and deliver services to refugees in the same way it does for Uganda’s citizens. This is in recognition that national, regional and local authorities have the primary responsibility to assist refugees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) in Uganda works in tandem with the local organization MapUganda to provide OpenStreetMap (OSM) tools, training, information management products and advisory services to humanitarian organizations working with refugees. HOT provides OSM tools to international organizations, local government and refugee communities, along with training, information management support and advisory services. Several volunteers are periodically trained to use OSM tools, and ready to support the humanitarian community with extensive data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Distribution of volunteers trained in using OSM tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key partnerships with UNHCR, WFP and international NGOs ensure that OSM assistance contributes to build a common operating picture for the response to the refugee crisis, avoid duplications and provide timely informed decisions to implementing agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mappers-in-turkey-support-uganda-in-turkeys-first-missing-maps-mapathon&quot;&gt;Mappers in Turkey Support Uganda in Turkey’s First Missing Maps Mapathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to the situation in Uganda, HOT and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sinirtanimayandoktorlar.org/&quot;&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières Turkey&lt;/a&gt; (MSF)organized Turkey’s First &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/&quot;&gt;Missing Maps&lt;/a&gt; Mapathon in Istanbul on June 18, 2017. 38 volunteers gathered at Impact Hub Istanbul to pitch in and stand #WithRefugees, demonstrating how volunteers can provide remote mapping support to assist refugees and bring humanitarian assistance to the ground. As residents who sympathize with the plight of refugees in their own country, the event provided participants with a unique opportunity to understand a different context, to show solidarity, and to give back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in Istanbul mapped 2,550 buildings in the Boroli, Olua and Ayilo Refugee Settlements, and completed 75% of the targeted region. They learned about Missing Maps, and HOT and MSF’s work. The majority of participants were new mappers, and were excited to learn about OSM and discover how they could contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 20, the HOT team in Uganda organized a mapathon in Kampala, with remote connection from MSF’s office in Yumbe, to contribute to the provisioning of up-to-date information on refugee settlements and hosting communities. The mapathon gathered several volunteers, humanitarian workers and representatives from UNHCR and WFP, and targeted mapping of shelters, main roads, boundaries for Maji Refugee Settlement and Adjumani Town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faculty and students at the George Washington University (GWU), including AGS President Marie Price, teamed up with the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) this March to bring digital mapping tools to vulnerable communities in Guatemala. The goal is to make life-saving information available to local planners, humanitarian aid workers and the community members themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivations-for-mapping&quot;&gt;Motivations for Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many urban informal communities are literally not on the map, so when emergencies happen they are hard to assist,” says Marie Price. “Mapping and surveying these areas improve our understanding of life threatening conditions and identify households that face the greatest risk.”  Price worked with colleague Dr. Nuala Cowan, who is an Assistant Professor at GWU and a leader in using open source data and tools for humanitarian purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;display: block;margin:auto; &quot; src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20170330_pricecowan.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Nuala Cowan and Dr. Marie Price with community members&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography Masters students Andrii Berdnyk and Sudie Brown developed workshops and surveys with PADF staff as part of their capstone project.  These materials were shared with colleagues at the University of Rafael Landívar as well as with community members from Ciudad Satélite in the Municipality of Mixco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mapping-workflow&quot;&gt;Mapping Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project began with students at the George Washington University remotely tracing buildings and roads in Ciudad Satélite from satellite imagery on to Open Street Map.  When in Guatemala, the research team worked with community members to validate and correct the maps using field papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;display: block;margin:auto; &quot; src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20170330_communitymembers.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Community members field validation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community members conducted surveys on the status of buildings as well as talked to household members to understand the threats faced by residents and the resources that they had to combat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maps and information were then shared with the community for planning purposes.  By the end of the week, a community that was virtually invisible on Google Maps was fully mapped on Open Street Map (OSM).
In addition, the research team worked with students and faculty at Rafael Landívar University to trace buildings and roads using OSM, to use mobile phone-based survey tools to collect information on household vulnerability, infrastructure and disaster preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;guatemala-project&quot;&gt;Guatemala Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PADF is currently implementing a disaster risk reduction project in Guatemala funded by Taiwan and is expected to facilitate the identification of communities most vulnerable to natural hazards, especially floods and landslides.  Faculty and staff from GWU got involved to pilot this innovative community mapping initiative using open source platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By putting open-data mapping technologies into the hands of local students, researchers and members of these communities themselves, we are building grassroots capacity,” says Aaron Van Alstine, Senior Programs Manager at PADF. “We’re empowering communities to take a leading role in preparing for disasters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the Missing Maps Project in 2014, there have been over 20,000 remote contributors mapping some of the most vulnerable communities in the world. All of the data created as part of this process is extremely valuable to the organizations who have requested it. One question commonly asked however, is about data quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our opinion, one of the greatest features of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tasks.hotosm.org&quot;&gt;Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Tasking Manager&lt;/a&gt; is the idea of validation. As the number of volunteers that HOT provides this great service for grows, providing positive feedback to new mappers and catching any mistakes that all new mappers make early on is critical to retaining mappers and ensuring quality data for the communities being mapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dekstop&lt;/code&gt;, Martin Dittus, recently wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/dekstop/diary/40421&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the impact of positive feedback on recently mapped tasks for retaining new mappers. We’re all looking forward to reading the full paper!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an OSM user who creates HOT tasks, I constantly get messages from invested mappers who want to make sure they’re mapping correctly. I &lt;strong&gt;LOVE&lt;/strong&gt; getting messages from users that show genuine interest in a project and are looking for ways to make sure they are making the most of their contribution to OpenStreetMap and the Missing Maps Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also seen some negative messages and feedback. Everyone was once a new mapper, but it’s important to remember that if we want mappers to continue mapping and to improve the quality of data, condescension and negative comments won’t get us there. Let’s remember that we are part of a community of over 3,000,000 contributors and we all want to make a better OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there are nearly 500 Missing Maps projects. The tasks within them are, on average, 90% percent marked as done, yet the validation average comes in at just under 50%. &lt;strong&gt;We can do better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-we-do&quot;&gt;What can we do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of avenues for requesting mapping assistance. To start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Message the project creator on the tasking manager. You can also leave comments in your task before you mark it as done or unlock it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sign up for and send a message on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/hot&quot;&gt;HOT Mailing List&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sign up for the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://hotosm-slack.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;HOT Slack Community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a two way street&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a validator and you see a mapper doing a great job, reach out to them! Tell them they’ve got the hang of things and suggest that they start validating some simpler tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember all those great badges you can earn on your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/users/#/&quot;&gt;Missing Maps User Profile&lt;/a&gt;? We’re going to start reaching out to those users who have soared to great heights and have been earning their &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Task Champion&lt;/code&gt; badges, so that we can encourage users to start validating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Earn your Task Champion and Scrutinizer Badges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask more questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great community willing to help you learn! See the list above about how to get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks and months, a number of resources will be released by members of the Missing Maps community. Use these, give feedback, and ASK QUESTIONS. We’ll be sure to share them far and wide, as well as keep them safe and sound here on the Missing Maps website. There’s already a few resources available to help you out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to Validate in iD Editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2h12CKnvK38&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MissingMaps/josm_styles&quot;&gt;validation style for JOSM&lt;/a&gt; that you can download and apply to your downloaded area; it highlights some common issues to look out for when validating. Follow the instructions on the GitHub link to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on that note…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn JOSM!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://josm.openstreetmap.de/&quot;&gt;Java OpenStreetMap Editor (JOSM)&lt;/a&gt; is a desktop editor for OSM and it will CHANGE. YOUR. LIFE. With helpful plugins and tools like the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Buildings Tool&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Validation Tool&lt;/code&gt;, tasks that can be somewhat tedious in iD Editor become easier by leaps and bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a fantastic walkthrough at &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnosm.org/en/josm/&quot;&gt;LearnOSM&lt;/a&gt; about learning JOSM. Spend a couple hours this weekend getting to know it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#ValidationFriday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, make time to validate. Earlier this year, we started #ValidationFriday. We use it as a reminder on every Friday to set aside some time to help validate a handful of tasks, giving positive and timely feedback to users. There are any number of great projects to choose from on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tasks.hotosm.org&quot;&gt;Tasking Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a simple &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;buildings only&lt;/code&gt; task, read the instructions, square buildings, align them with imagery and ask for feedback on your validation. I’ve seen several instances of users starting to validate, and then asking another user either on the mailing list or Slack channel to check their work. That’s okay, in fact, I encourage that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-be-afraid-to-say-hi&quot;&gt;Don’t Be Afraid to Say “Hi”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a great community of Missing Map-ers who are ready to help you learn to validate. We all have the goal of improving maps for vulnerable communities, and we all come to the greater OSM community with different levels of experience. Let’s start validating and remember the wise words of Uncle Ben, “With great tasks, comes great validation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first of several post that we will be releasing in the next few weeks and months to better document Portable OSM. We use POSM extensively in our work and more and more people have asked how they can get started. This guide will cover how to get POSM up and running on an Amazon EC2 instance. Future guides will walkthrough how to install POSM on an Intel NUC and our model and methods for doing large scale OSM field data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-posm-in-the-cloud&quot;&gt;Running POSM in the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in running POSM in the cloud? This type of setup is great for semi-connected instances when you want the integration of OpenMapKit/Field Papers/OSM but have more regular connectivity with your surveyors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, this guide will walk through how to set things up in Amazon Web Services, specifically EC2. If you like another flavor or cloud services such as Azure, this process will still work but may look slightly different. This guide will also &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; show you how to get an AWS account, they already have great &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-a-fully-qualified-domain-name&quot;&gt;Get a Fully Qualified Domain Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before installation, you should choose a domain name and host to use to access your new POSM and configure it with your DNS provider. If you don’t do this, you won’t be able to access the OpenStreetMap interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the subdomain &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;osm.example.org&lt;/code&gt; . You’ll configure the DNS later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instance-setup&quot;&gt;Instance Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you will need to do is start a new instance. In your AWS EC2 Dashboard click on Launch instance. Scroll all the way down and find Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. The posm-build process only works on Ubuntu 14.04 at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/i7i2ogE.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Be sure the chose Ubuntu 14.04 LTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After selecting your instance type you’ll need to fill out a couple more things. Below are the recommended specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nZG3h71.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Pick the instance that works for you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommended specs for your instance are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 14.04 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mandatory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At least 2GB RAM, 8GB+ preferred
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you use less than 8GB, you will not be able to run the OSM part of POSM. OpenMapKit Server runs happily on 2GB.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If using SuperPOSM (OpenDroneMap), the more RAM the better&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At least 10GB of attached storage
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Not an issue unless you have lots of photos or will be processing OpenDroneMap images&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open ports 22 and 80
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;22 is needed to SSH into the server for administration and setup&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;80 is needed to view the various resources&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our internal instance runs on a t3.medium with 8GB of RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;configure-dns&quot;&gt;Configure DNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the instance is created, also create an elastic IP and assign it to the instance you just created. AWS has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#working-with-eips&quot;&gt;great guide&lt;/a&gt; for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now configure the DNS. Create an @ record and point it to the IP address that you just created and assigned to your instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample DNS records:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.org     A     1.2.3.4
osm.example.org CNAME example.org
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-posm&quot;&gt;Install POSM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POSM Cloud uses posm-build to install because the live ubuntu instance for physical devices doesn’t work. The process take a little longer and requires a little bit of command line knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To configure POSM on your cloud host, &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html&quot;&gt;connect to it&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; and run the following commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# become root&lt;/span&gt;
sudo -i

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# update instance for security patches&lt;/span&gt;
apt-get install update &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; apt-get install upgrade

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# install git if necessary&lt;/span&gt;
apt update &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; apt install --no-install-recommends -y git

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# clone this repository&lt;/span&gt;
git clone https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/posm-build

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# edit your settings (posm_hostname, posm_domain)&lt;/span&gt;
vi posm-build/kickstart/etc/settings

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important things to edit are &lt;em&gt;posm_hostname&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;posm_domain&lt;/em&gt;. Set these equal to your hostname and domain that your purchased earlier. You can comfortably ignore all the wifi settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not comfortable with editing files via command line here is a quick guide to using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/a&gt;. The important thing is to hit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to edit and then after making changes hit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; and type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wq&lt;/code&gt; to “write and quit”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uSo3ZCU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Adjust posm_hostname and posm_domain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing is to install everything. This will take a while; go get a snack and come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/root/posm-build/kickstart/scripts/bootstrap.sh base virt nodejs ruby gis mysql postgis nginx osm fieldpapers omk tl carto tessera admin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above command will install everything needed to run POSM Cloud but &lt;em&gt;will not install&lt;/em&gt; OpenDroneMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add SuperPOSM capabilities (OpenDroneMap + GeoTIFF processing), use the following instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/root/posm-build/kickstart/scripts/bootstrap.sh base virt nodejs ruby gis mysql postgis nginx osm fieldpapers omk tl carto tessera admin docker redis opendronemap imagery
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;omk-server-settings&quot;&gt;OMK Server Settings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenMapKit server does not apply authentication out of the box; you will need to set it up to ensure that sensitive information cannot be viewed on your cloud instance. This step requires more command line knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the POSM cloud install was successful, then you should now be able edit your OMK server settings. You will need to uncomment the lines starting with “auth” and add in the credentials you would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo vi /opt/omk/OpenMapKitServer/settings.js

&lt;p&gt;I first met &lt;a href=&quot;http://hiaragirlpower.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/rhobis-story-why-she-cares-so.html&quot;&gt;Rhobi&lt;/a&gt; in a building site in Mugumu, Serengeti,  Tanzania, in September 2014 where she was desperately trying to get a Safe House for girls refusing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&quot;&gt;Female Genital Mutilation&lt;/a&gt; finished before the “cutting season” started in December.  In the week we spent together I accompanied her and her team as they visited the surrounding villages, telling the villagers the dangers of FGM through debates, drama and dance.  Rhobi almost &lt;a href=&quot;http://hiaragirlpower.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/rhobis-story-why-she-cares-so.html&quot;&gt;bled to death&lt;/a&gt; from FGM in one of these villages as a 13 year old and has been a passionate advocate for womens’ rights ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we bounced along the dusty tracks in a rusty over crowded car, frequently getting lost and stopping to ask for directions, I was frustrated by everyone’s complete lack of maps.  I had been inspired to learn about Openstreetmap at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Programme&quot;&gt;Wikimania&lt;/a&gt; London the previous month, and had even printed out basic maps to ask Rhobi to mark villages on before I visited.  That was a failure, as was my mapping attempts that time.  No one I met had a good understanding of where the villages were on paper and I was thwarted by poor connectivity and inadequate tools or understanding.   Later on my trip I was amazed to find my GPS at Zeze, and village of 9000 people showed a completely blank map.  I was 2 hours late visiting Ikondo School after driving round in circles through muddy rivers in torrential rain trying to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozillafestival.org/&quot;&gt;Mozfest&lt;/a&gt; in October 2015 I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/eglemarija/&quot;&gt;Egle&lt;/a&gt;, a citizen science expert talking about mapping the locations of water points and other objects using &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.epicollect.net/TDTschoolsResourceMap/Resources?Resources_key=&quot;&gt;EpiCollect&lt;/a&gt;. I told her of our need to map village locations. She was shocked to learn that the online maps were still so poor in places like rural Tanzania, and together we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://crowd2map.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Crowd2Map&lt;/a&gt;, a crowdsourced mapping project, using remote and local mappers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.me/en/home&quot;&gt;Maps.Me&lt;/a&gt; produced their version that allowed edits into Openstreetmap we started using it instead, including developing a Swahili version.  We held a mapping party in Dar es Salaam, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://ramanihuria.org/&quot;&gt;Ramani Huria&lt;/a&gt;, London, &lt;a href=&quot;https://technarium.lt/&quot;&gt;Vilnius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/MugumuSafeHouse/?fref=ts&quot;&gt;Safe House&lt;/a&gt; in May 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now recruited over 900 online volunteers and 199 local mappers.  In our 2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1788&quot;&gt;HOT tasks&lt;/a&gt; in Mara region 696 mappers have mapped an area of 14,248 square kilometres and added 5 towns and 169 villages and hamlets.  We’ve also added 42,128 km of roads and tracks and 700,000 buildings..   Countrywide we have added 12,294 schools and  162 clinics to Openstreetmap from &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendata.go.tz/&quot;&gt;government open data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I visited the Safe House for the 5th time in  December 2016 I took out a printed map.  This, together with Maps.Me on Rhobi’s phone meant that when a phone call came in saying “there is a girl in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4527206595&quot;&gt;Sogoti&lt;/a&gt; village who needs rescuing from cutting tonight” she knew where to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having better maps helped prevent 2257 girls from being cut this year.  However change is a slow process.  1076 girls were cut, down from 3700 the previous year, and 4 girls died, down from 12 last year.  There is an interactive map showing the location of FGM incidents &lt;a href=&quot;https://jachapman82.carto.com/builder/4324bc10-f250-11e6-9d00-0ee66e2c9693/embed&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girls like Bhoke* forcibly cut at 13, her body &lt;a href=&quot;http://hiaragirlpower.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/5-girls-bodies-thrown-into-bush.html&quot;&gt;thrown into the bush&lt;/a&gt;.  But the tide is turning.  This year saw the first prosecutions against parents and cutters for FGM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Safe House sheltered over 200 girls this year.  Girls like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A2HB0XGHvs&quot;&gt;Jackline&lt;/a&gt; were saved from being cut and married off against their will.  Now she can pursue her dream to become a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more information about this project in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ajplusenglish/videos/873491619459013/&quot;&gt;2 minute video on Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;, and this article in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/06/online-mapping-tool-gives-fgm-runaways-a-path-to-help?CMP=twt_a-world_b-gdnworld&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local mappers are continuing to improve the map by adding the names of missing villages across Tanzania, but we are a volunteer run project with no budget and access to smartphones is a limiting factor.  If anyone has any unwanted phones we can make very good use of them!  Please contact us &lt;a href=&quot;https://crowd2map.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016 was a busy year for the the American Red Cross and the Missing Maps project. Community-led mapping projects took place in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2015/03/29/riohacha-colombia/&quot;&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, Ecuador, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/06/07/zimbabwe/&quot;&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;. Our largest undertaking since the start of the Missing Maps project was in West Africa. Covering an area the size of Switzerland, volunteers in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone visited over 7,000 communities in an area that experienced the worst of the Ebola crisis in 2014 and 2015. Here’s a snapshot of what the volunteers accomplished:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/westafrica_stats_horizontal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quick stats&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A few West Africa stats at a glance. CC-BY American Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, this project could not have been possible without the dedication of the Red Cross volunteers in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Over 120 volunteers plus an additional 109 motorbike drivers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2017/01/07/gps-tracks/&quot;&gt;traveled 72,000 km&lt;/a&gt; visiting some of the most vulnerable communities in West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the West Africa project because information gaps in available data made it more difficult to combat Ebola. Accurate maps play a critical role in understanding human communities, especially for populations at risk. The lack of detailed maps for West Africa posed a problem during the 2014 Ebola crisis; contact tracing was much more difficult without accurate names and locations for all of the villages, particularly in the border areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mapping project involved five processes, which consisted of tech development, a mapping hub, a rapid assessment survey, detailed community mapping, and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/project_phases.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Project Phases. CC-BY American Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the field work, we estimated that there were about 5,000 communities in the target area (based off of OpenStreetMap data). When we actually got on the ground, however, our volunteers visited 7,000 communities. Planning and logistics were a real challenge for this project - here’s what 7,000 communities look like across the area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tech-development&quot;&gt;Tech Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our standard mapping tools consist of Android phones, OpenDataKit and &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmapkit.org&quot;&gt;OpenMapKit&lt;/a&gt; apps, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldpapers.org&quot;&gt;Field Papers&lt;/a&gt;. These apps are cloud-based and most of the enormous project area lacked connectivity (data signals and wifi). We know this would be a real challenge; without a signal, volunteers can’t upload surveys and staff can’t monitor progress or do troubleshooting. To address this issue, we developed &lt;a href=&quot;http&quot;&gt;Portable OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; or POSM, a portable offline server. POSM enables us to do our full workflow offline and gave field team leaders a way to gather and push data in areas where there is no connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how POSM works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/posm_forblog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;POSM: more than just a cute name&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;POSM workflow. CC-BY American Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of our code is available on GitHub, so please contribute as we continue to improve our mapping tools! &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/posm&quot;&gt;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/posm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mapping-hub-and-community-engagement&quot;&gt;Mapping Hub and Community Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mapping hub was established in Guéckédou, Guinea, which served as an operations base and a community engagement facility. Local GIS staff used the mapping hub as a central location to clean incoming data and interact with the local community, building capacity in both the use of OpenStreetMap and general computer, technical, and language skills. POSM also allowed the staff and volunteers to trace features into OpenStreetMap in an offline environment. This process is highlighted &lt;a href=&quot;https://hi.stamen.com/merging-offline-edits-with-the-posm-replay-tool-2f39a4410d2a#.owg36t8sy&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Through partners in each country, local OSM groups formed to continue mapping communities both inside and outside of the initial project area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rapid-assessment-and-detailed-community-mapping&quot;&gt;Rapid Assessment and Detailed Community Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After initial training in ODK Collect and OpenMapKit use, the project began with a rapid assessment survey where volunteers visited every community within a distance of 15km of the Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone borders. The survey consisted of questions related to access to health facilities, access to markets, access to clean drinking water, as well as inquired about the community’s experience to natural disasters in recent years. These questions were used to create a vulnerability index for all 7,000 communities in the project area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the vulnerability index and major population centers, 104 communities were selected for detailed mapping; 26 in Liberia, 41 in Guinea, and 37 in Sierra Leone. Volunteers traced buildings and roads into OpenStreetMap and returned to these communities to map water points, schools, and and general points of interest. Using OpenMapKit, 300 health facilities, 400 education facilities, 3,500 water points, and over 12,000 points of interest were all added to OpenStreetMap. Data that was collected was reviewed for accuracy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/workflows/blob/master/west-africa_data-cleaning.md&quot;&gt;(workflow can be found on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and uploaded to OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the data collected and the communities visited, roughly 800 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fixme&lt;/code&gt; location and name tags were removed from the project area in OpenStreetMap. Many of what appeared to be communities were actually seasonal farms or long abandoned villages. Many of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fixme&lt;/code&gt; tags marked communities that were based on out-of-date maps and government data that was over 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-members&quot;&gt;New Members&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in 2014, the Missing Maps partnership has grown from four original partners to a large and committed community of NGOs, academic institutions, companies, and most of all, individual mappers. Since our launch, we’ve added some amazing new members, all of whom have committed to the goals and ethics of Missing Maps.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, we registered thousands of users and held mapathons in 47 countries! Many groups hosted regular &lt;a href=&quot;http://missingmaps.org/events&quot;&gt;events&lt;/a&gt;, with mapathons held monthly in London, Prague, and DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;success&quot;&gt;Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A highlight of 2016 was conducting extensive field mapping with local volunteers in the border areas of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/04/25/west-africa-mapping-hub-launch/&quot;&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt;. They completed field surveys in 7,200 villages and added health facilities, water points, and community resources to OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote mappers played a significant role in helping save lives in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. During a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/7a6df79c-c139-11e6-81c2-f57d90f6741a&quot;&gt;yellow fever emergency response&lt;/a&gt;, mapped data aided planning and logistics to vaccinate 700,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/07/14/mapswipe/&quot;&gt;MapSwipe&lt;/a&gt; app was also launched in 2016. Using fast satellite image classification on mobile devices, users can rapidly identify population clusters to better target mapping. So far, over 13,000 users have identified over 9 million features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank YOU!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing for us to look back and see how much we’ve accomplished together as a community. On behalf of all the Missing Maps partners, thanks to each and every volunteer who’s helped with the mapping and contributed to the project - we couldn’t do it without you!&lt;/p&gt;

Now that fieldwork is complete, we finally had a chance to look through the hundreds of GPX files that they recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was merging the many, many GPX files. There were 72,000 km of tracks recorded - equal to circling the Earth 1.8 times! Since the dataset was so large, the best way was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ptrv/gpx2spatialite&quot;&gt;combine the files into a spatialite database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we cleaned up the data. This involved removing any GPX track points with a speed higher than 100 kph (which only happened when a staff member got on a flight and forgot to put their phone on airplane mode) and any track points that were floating in weird places (we had some points appear in Kenya and null island - these were from when the GPS on a phone was first turned on and was trying to search for a signal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mapped the data to see the full extent of how much ground the volunteers covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data aren’t just pretty; they’re also useful for adding roads to OSM. Several areas in the border regions have really cloudy satellite imagery and we wouldn’t be able to trace the roads if it weren’t for the GPX data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the GPX data to complete the road network. First, I needed to figure out which of the tracks were for roads that already existed in OSM. I did this by downloading the existing road data and calculating how far each GPX point was from an existing road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to do this. I did it by downloading the country-level OSM-PBF file from &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.geofabrik.de/&quot;&gt;GeoFabrik&lt;/a&gt; (these are faster to download than shapefiles), &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/workflows/blob/master/converting_pbf_into_spatialite.md&quot;&gt;converting this into a spatialite database&lt;/a&gt;, and filtering the data by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;highway=*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPX data and the roads data both had to be saved in an equal area projection so that the distance calculations would be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within QGIS, I used the v.distance function in GRASS. It’s slightly hidden. You can find it under:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Processing -&amp;gt; Toolbox -&amp;gt; GRASS -&amp;gt; v.distance&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This iterated through each of the GPX track points to determine the closest road and the distance between the road and the point. I took the output and filtered the data to only keep track points that were over 100 metres from an existing road. This left me with a set of points that needed to be traced into OSM, which I did using JOSM; you can add in a GPX track points layer on top of existing data and imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days, 8 episodes of Game of Thrones, and one sore arm later, the tracing was complete. Through the volunteers’ efforts, we added about 600 km of roads into OSM, connecting some of the most inaccessible and remote communities in West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the volunteers who made this possible!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Emily Eros</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="West Africa" /><category term="Field Mapping" /><category term="Red Cross" /><category term="GPS" /><category term="osmAnd" /><category term="roads" /><summary type="html">Red Cross volunteers on motorbikes logged 72,000 km of GPS tracks during border mapping in West Africa.
